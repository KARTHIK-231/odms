there are still issues.


make an index.php from there links to:


register.php and login.php for buyers


seller_register and seller_login php files


delivery_signup and delivery_signin php files 


make the database "ecom" and tables as specified in sql file 

you can add more columns like featured,bestsellers,offers in products without tampering the existing structure or codes to dynamically fetch items based on these
